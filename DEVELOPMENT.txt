Week1: We first decide to the anime list search enigne, but we find it's really hard to implement graph algorithm. 
Therefore, we decide to change our project to find shortest path between 2 airports using OpenFlight csv dataset, 
BFS traversal, A-Start Search algorithm, and Floyd Warshall algorithm. csv dataset, main.cpp, airport.h commit to git.
Week2: Thanksgiving break, no work complete during this week.
Week3: Since we find that our main.cpp still have some issue running on ews, we delete the main.cpp. After the group meeting, 
we decide that combine all the code together into main.cpp is really hard to debug, so this time we break it down into serval pieces to upload. 
Besides this, this week we finish bfs traversal and astar algorithm, start debuging on Floyd Warshall algorithm and upload the small airline csv dataset for Floyd Warshall algorithm. 
Week4: We finish Floyd Warshall algorithm, test case, utils.cpp, and utils.h. We update Makefile, main.cpp, and airports.csv. The program is able to run correctly.  
We upload the final video, the result of the program, README.md, and upload the pdf version of the weekly development.
